//Calculate an Earned Run Average

//Create a function that returns an Earned Run Average (ERA). An ERA is calculated by multiplying 9 by the quotient of Earned Runs Allowed er divided by ip Innings Pitched.
//
//In baseball statistics, innings are represented with a fractional part of .1 (1/3) or .2 (2/3) to represent the number of outs in an inning.
//A whole number or a number with a fractional part of .0 represents
//a full inning with three outs. Check the Resources tab for a deeper explanation.

	result+=std::to_string(ans);

	return result.substr(0,4);
