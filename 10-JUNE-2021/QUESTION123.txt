//Cup Swapping
//There are three cups on a table, at positions A, B, and C. At the start, there is a ball hidden under the cup at position B.
//
//Image of cups where ball is under middle cup
//
//However, I perform several swaps on the cups, which is notated as two letters. For example, if I swap the cups at positions A and B, I could notate this as AB or BA.
//
//Create a function that returns the letter position that the ball is at, once I finish swapping the cups. The swaps will be given to you as an array.
//
//Worked Example
//cupSwapping(["AB", "CA", "AB"]) ➞ "C"
//
//// Ball begins at position B.
//// Cups A and B swap, so the ball is at position A.
//// Cups C and A swap, so the ball is at position C.
//// Cups A and B swap, but the ball is at position C, so it doesn't move.
//Examples
//cupSwapping(["AB", "CA"]) ➞ "C"
//
//cupSwapping(["AC", "CA", "CA", "AC"]) ➞ "B"
//
//cupSwapping(["BA", "AC", "CA", "BC"]) ➞ "A"
//Notes
//A swap could be notated in two different ways, since both ways end up with the same outcome.
//All swaps will be notated as capital letters and will be valid.
//You cannot swap a cup with itself.
