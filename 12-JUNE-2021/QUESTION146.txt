//Hole Number Sequence
//What do the digits 0, 4, 6, 8, and 9 have in common? Well, they are whole numbers... and they are also hole numbers (not actually a thing until now). Hole numbers are numbers with holes in their shapes (8 is special in that it contains two holes).
//
//14 is a hole number with one hole. 88 is a hole number with four holes.
//
//Your task is to create a function with argument N that returns the sum of the holes for the integers n in the range of range 0 < n <= N.
//
//To illustrate, sumOfHoles(14) returns 7, because there are 7 holes in 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 and 14.
