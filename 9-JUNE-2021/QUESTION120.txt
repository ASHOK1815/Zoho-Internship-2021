//Numbers Transformation

//Mubashir (as always) needs your help to complete his assignment.
//
//You are given two positive integers n and m. You have to perform some basic mathematical operations on n to obtain m. These are your options:
//
//(n-1)/2   - if (n-1) is divisible by 2
//n/2       - if n is divisible by 2
//n*2
//Create a function that returns the minimum number of steps required to transform n into m.
//
//Examples
//numberTransform(2, 8) ➞ 2
//// 2 * 2 = 4
//// 4 * 2 = 8
//
//numberTransform(9, 2) ➞ 2
//// (9-1) / 2 = 4
//// 4 / 2 = 2
//
//numberTransform(1024, 1024) ➞ 0
