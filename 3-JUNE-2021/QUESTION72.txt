//
//How Many Shuffles?
//
//An out-shuffle, also known as an out Faro shuffle or a perfect shuffle, is a controlled method for shuffling playing cards.
//It is performed by splitting the deck into two equal halves and interleaving them together perfectly, with the condition that the top card of the deck remains in place.
//
//Using an array to represent a deck of cards, an out-shuffle looks like:

#include<bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int shuffleCount(int num)
 {
    if(num == 2)
    {
       return 1;
    }
    int counter = 0;
    int fin = 1;
    while(true){

        fin = fin * 2;
        counter++;
        if(fin % (num - 1) == 1)
        {
            return counter;
        }
    }
}


int main()
{

    int num;
    cin>>num;


    cout<<shuffleCount(num);





    return 0;
}
