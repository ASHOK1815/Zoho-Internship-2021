//Maximum Travel Distance
//Write a function that takes fuel (liters), fuelUsage (liters/100km), passengers, airCon (boolean) and returns maximum distance
// that car can travel.
//
//fuel is the number of liters of fuel in the fuel tank.
//fuelUsage is basic fuel consumption per 100 km (with the driver inside only).
//Every additional passenger is increasing basic fuel consumption by 5%.
//If the air conditioner is ON true, its increasing total (not basic) fuel consumption by 10%.
//Examples
//totalDistance(70.0, 7.0, 0, false) ➞ 1000.0
//
//totalDistance(36.1, 8.6, 3, true) ➞ 331.8
//
//totalDistance(55.5, 5.5, 5, false) ➞ 807.3
//Notes
//fuel and fuelUsage are always greater than 1.
//passengers are always greater or equal to 0.
//Round your answer to the nearest tenth
